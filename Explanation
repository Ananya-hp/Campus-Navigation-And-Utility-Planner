📘Campus Navigation And Utility Planner

🔎 Introduction
This project is designed to help model a university campus using data structures and algorithms. 
It shows how trees and graphs can be applied to real‑world problems like storing building information, finding the shortest paths between locations, and planning cost‑effective utility layouts.

1. 🏫 Building Data ADT
 Each building is represented as a record with:
 - BuildingID → unique integer identifier
 - BuildingName → name of the building
 - LocationDetails → description of the building’s purpose or location
These records are stored in trees (BST and AVL) for fast searching and retrieval.

2.🌳 Trees
1. Binary Search Tree (BST)
 - Stores building records in sorted order by ID.
 - Supports insertion, search, and traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder).
 - Limitation: can become unbalanced if data is sorted.

2. AVL Tree
 - A self‑balancing BST.
 - Performs rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL) to keep the tree balanced.
 - Ensures faster search and insertion compared to BST.
 - Height comparison between BST and AVL shows AVL is more efficient

3.📊 Graphs
The campus is represented as a graph:
-Nodes → Buildings
-Edges → Paths between buildings with weights (distances)

Implemented using:
-Adjacency List → efficient for sparse graphs
-Adjacency Matrix → easy to visualize connections

4. Graph Traversals
 - BFS (Breadth First Search) → explores buildings level by level.
 - DFS (Depth First Search) → explores buildings deeply before backtracking.
Both are demonstrated with user input for the starting building

5. Algorithms
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm → finds the shortest path between buildings.
  - Kruskal’s Algorithm → builds a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to plan utility layouts (like cables) with minimum cost.

6. Expression Tree
 - An expression tree is used to calculate energy bills.
 - User enters a postfix expression (e.g., 120 6 * 150 + 50 -).
 - The tree evaluates the expression step by step.
 - Final result gives the total bill.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
1.Apply trees and graphs to practical campus navigation problems.
2.Understand differences between BST and AVL trees.
3.Implement graph algorithms for shortest path and minimum spanning tree.
4.Use expression trees for real‑world calculations.
