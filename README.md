**📘Campus Navigation and Utility Planner**

**📖 Overview**

**This Python based project implements Trees and Graph Algorithms for campus navigation and utility planning. It models university buildings, finds optimal paths, and plans resource delivery routes using BST, AVL Trees, Graphs, Dijkstra, Kruskal, and Expression Trees.**

**🎯 Features**

**1. Building Data ADT**

- BuildingID, BuildingName, LocationDetails

**2. Binary Search Tree (BST)**

- Insert, Search, Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

**3. AVL Tree**

- Self-balancing with rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL)

- Height comparison with BST

**4. Graph Representation**

- Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix

**5. Graph Traversals**

- BFS and DFS

**6. Algorithms**

- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)

- Kruskal’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)

**7. Expression Tree**
   
- Energy bill calculation using arithmetic expressions
